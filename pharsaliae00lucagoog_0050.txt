10 LUCAN'S PHARsAmA. [Bk. 1. 215—240

2 15 From modest source glides down, and rolls in scanty waves
the dark Rubicon, when torrid summer glows:
and creeps through the lowest valeS, and, a fixed boundary,
separates the Gallie territories from Ausonian settlerS.
Then winter was furnishing strength, and now the third moon
220 rainy with its boding crescent had increased its waves,
and the Alps melted by the moist breezes of Eurus.
F 1rst into the cross- -wise stream is urged the horse,
to try the waters: with easy passage then the rest of the
crowd
breaks upon the yielding waves of the stream now overcome.
22 5 When Caesar, having passed the rapids, reached the opposite
shore,
and planted his foot upon the forbidden fields of Hesperia:
“ Here '² he exclaims “ here I leave peace and my violated
rights :
“thee‚ Fortune, I follow. Far hence avaunt ye treaties l
“ We have trusted the fateS. We must employ war as¹ judge
to decide.''-— ‚
2 30 Thus he spake and hurried on his troops in the darkness of
night,
a restless leader, swifter than the shot-bolt of the Balearic
sling,
and than the arrow of the Parthian discharged in retreat3
and with hostile purpose invades the neighbouring Ariminum.
The starS, ³
Δ with Lucifer remaining, were fleeing from before sun's fireS,
2 3 5 and now the day that was to see' first tumults of war
ariseS. Whether through the will of the godS, or whether

¹ drove tilielrhteb'er the heaven, clouds possessed the light in
l .
When ἕώέοῐὲοῙᾶίετε halted in the captured market-place,
ordered to

plant their standardS, impious were the notes which the
braying of homs and the clang of trumpets
240 with the hoarse clarion sent forth in concert.
