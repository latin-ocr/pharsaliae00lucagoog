Bk. 1. 344—368] LucAn's PHARSALIA. ³15

“ service be paid: let that soldiery triumph under any leader
you please.
345 “ Whither will my soldiers of shrivelled age betake themselves ?
“ What home' will be found for the discharged ? What lands
will be assigned,
“ which my veteran is to plough ? What walls for the wearied Ρ
“ Or shall pirates rather become our colonists oh ! Magnus Ρ
“ Raise your long victorious standards, raise them ἒ
350 “ We must employ the forces, which we have created: to him
who has arms
“he gives all thingS, who denies justice. Nor will the gods
fail us ε ’
“ for it is not booty‚ it is not a kingdom that is sought by my ·
arms z
“ we drag tyrants from the neck of a city prepared to bea slave.''
Α He spake z but the wavering soldiery with indistinct murmurs
355 hold divided converse with buz and hum : affection and their
ancestral penates
sap their feelings and swelling spirim, albeit maddened with
slaughter:
but by the hateful love of the sword they are recalled
and by awe of their leader. Thereupon LaeIiUS, holding the
office osprimpilaris,
and bearing the decoration of a badge earned in war,
360 an oak crown representing the recompense for a saved citizen,
exclaims: “ If it be allowed me, oh! supreme ruler of the
ι Roman name,
“ and it be right to put forth true expressions of feeling:
“it is that such tarrying patience has held back your forceS,
“ that we complain : did you lack confidence in us Ρ
365 “while warm life-blood keeps these bodies breathing and in
motion,
“ and while our arms are able with power to hurl pila,
“ wilt thou endure the unworthy toga, and the tyranny of the
senate Ρ
“ Is it to such extent a wretched thing to be victorious in
civil war Ρ
