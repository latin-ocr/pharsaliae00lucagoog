Bk. 1. 542—565] LUCAN’s PHARsALrA. 23

The sun himself when raising his head ftom mid OlympuS‚
hid his blazing car in black gloom,
and wrapt the world in darknesS‚ and compelled mankind
545 to despair of day: such was the night which, the sun flying
through the East,
the Thyestean Mycenae passed.
’ The mouths of Sicilian Aetna fierce Mulciber let loose,
{nor did it raise heavenward its flameS‚ but with downward
stream
the fire fell on the Westem side. Fen Charybdis
550 tllreW„‚PR‚‚‚leOdrred waters from her depthS. With piteous
whine

howled savage dogs (of Scylla). The fire- from Vesta's
r
was toriiegwsst: and the flame that shows the Latin festival

n
becomeast diogen, and rises with two-fold peak,
after the fashion of the Theban pyres, Then on its hinge
the earth
555 stopped, and, as their heights waved to and fr0, the Alps
shook off the long-lain snow. Tethys with greater waves
washed on the Hesperian Calpe,· and o'er the summit of
Atlas ε
that the gods of the country shed team, and that with sweat
the Lares
testified to the city’s woeS‚ and that dedications fell from the
walls
560 of their proper temples‚ and that ill-omened birds ill-starred
the da
we hear: and‘ythat wild-beasts at nightfall leaving the woods
with boldness made their lairs in the midst of Rome.
Qu the tongues Osfiattle became apt at human utteranceS‚
and there were human offsp'r'ifig deformed both in number
and fashion

565 of their limbs, and mothers were panic stricken at their own
infantS.
