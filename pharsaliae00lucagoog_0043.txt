Bk. 1. 43—67] LUCAN'S PHARSALIA. 3

and the servile wars waged under blazing AEtna:
yet much does Rome owe to civil wars,
45 because for thee was it done. When, after finishing your
watch,
you shall late seek the stam, the palace of wide heaven
shall receive thee, while the pole rej0iceS‚ whether to hold
sway‚
or to mount the flaming chariots of PhoebuS,
and to traverse with wandering fire the earth that fears nothing
50 though the sun bechanged,
it delight thee τ to thee by every deity
shall right be conceded : and to your own caprice shall nature
yield‚
what god you please to be, where to fix your kingdom o' er
the world.
But neither 1n the Arctic circle select for thyself a seat, ·
55 nor where the warm pole of theAntarctic South declineS,
whence to gaze on thine own Rome with setting constellation.
If thou shalt have weighed down one side of the boundless
aether,
earth' s axis will feel the load. Keep the weights of the
balanced heavens
in the middle of the world: let that portion of. cloudless
aether
60 be wholly free, and let no cloud interrupt on Caesar's side.
Then let the human race, laying down armS‚ jconsult its own
happineSS,
and every nation show mutual love: let Peace sent through
the world
close fast the 1ron gates of warlike Jauus, .
E’en now thou art my deity: nor, if Ι, a hard, received thine
influence
65 in my breast, would I wish to ply with prayers the god that
sways
the secret shrines of Cirrha, or to divert Bacchus from Nysa.
Thou art enough to furnish me vigour for Roman song.
