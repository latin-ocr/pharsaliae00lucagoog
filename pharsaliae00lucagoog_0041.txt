LUCAN'S

PHARSAL1A‚
BoOKI.

WARS more than civil (waged) o'er the Emathian plainS‚
and power consigned to iniquity I sing, and a powerful'people,
’ turned against its own vitals with victorious right hand,
and kindred ranks (opposed in fight), and, the compact of
power violated‚
5 a contest waged with the whole forces of the shaken globe,
to universal min, and standards meeting hostile standardS,
eagles matched, and pila menacing pila. ¹
What madnesS‚ Oh ἔ citizens ἔ what lust for the sword so great,
to lavish Latian blood on hostile nations Ρ ’

“ 10 And while proud Babylon remained to be spoiled oi* her

trophies
Ausonian, and Crassus was wandering with unavenged shade‚
was it your pleasure that wars productive of no triumphs
should be waged ?¹
Ah ! how vast a tract of land and sea might have been won
by this life-blood which hands of citizens let flow! “
15 Whence Titan comeS, and where night hides her stam,
and where the mid-dass} flames with ‚burning hours‚
and where winter, stark and that knows not to be relaxed
by spring,
binds the icy sea with Scythian cold.
Now under the yoke had the SereS‚ now had barbaric Araxes
come,
20 and nations if there be any that lie privy to the rising of the
Nile.
