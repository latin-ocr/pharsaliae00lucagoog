Marcus Annaeus Lucanus was born at Corduba, in Spain,
A. D. 39. He was nephew of M. Seneca the philosopher.
Having provoked the jealousy of Nero, he was prohibited from
reciting in public: he joined in a conspiracy against the
Emperor, but Î‡subsequently turned informer against his asso-
ciateS. F inally to avoid being put to death he opened his own
veinS, and died A. D. 65. in the 26th year of his age. The
Pharsalia, an heroic poem, is his only extant production. It is
grand, but laboured: and is full of language more capable of
being understood than expressed.
