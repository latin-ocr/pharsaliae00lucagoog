PREFACE.

—

THE Text is that of Weise, whose notes have been con·
sulted with no small benefit. Weber seems to think that
unbounded liberties may be taken with the text, and his notes
present much variety, and admit of great choice: they have
therefore not been of much service in preparing an edition
for the use of Poll-men. Ι have made the attempt to
translate line for line: Ι think that all verse authors should
be so translated in all examinationS. Merivale's ‘ F all of the
Roman Republie' cannot be too¹ highly recommended to all
students who wish to obtain, by pleasant reading, a knowledge
of the events of the ‘last century of the Commonwealthss
