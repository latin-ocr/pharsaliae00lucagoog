Bk. 1. 6384-660] LUCAN'S PHARSALIA. 27

“and may there be no truth in the entrails: but let it be
found that
“ TageS, inventor of the art, has seigned these.'' Thus
wrapping the omens
640 in much and mazy intricacy did the Tuscan obscurely sing.
But Figulus whose business it was· to be acquainted with
the Gods' will
and heaven's secretS‚ for whom Aegyptian Memphis could
find no equal
in studying the stass, and in the numerical laws which guide
planetS,
exclaims: “ Either this world wanders without law through-
out eternity,
645 “ and the stars hurry hither and thither with unguided
movement,
“ or, if the fates guide it, for our city and the human race
“is pre'pared a ripe destruction. Shall the earth gape
“and cities be engulphed? or shall the heated air withdraw
“its tempered warmth? shall earth be false and refuse her
fruits ?
650 “ or shall all waters be mingled with infused poisons Ρ
“ “ what kind of destruction ? oh 1 gods above 1 with what
fatal weapon
V “do ye prepare your rage ? The last hours of many have
come
“ at once. If in the topmost vault of heaven
‘⁴ the 'chill baleful star of Saturn were kindling its black fires,
655 “ Aquarius had poured forth waters of Deucalion's time,
“ and the whole earth had become submerged in the flood
spread o’er her.
“ If PhoebuS, thou wert now urging on the raging Nemean
lion ,
“ with thy rayS, flames had been raging o'er the whole world,
“ and aether had become in a blaze‚ ,lit by thy car.
660 ‘⁴ These fires are still z thou who art lighting up the threaten-
ing Scorpion
