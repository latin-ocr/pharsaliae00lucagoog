28 LUCAN'S PHARSALIA. [Bk. 1. 661—687

“ with blazing tail‚ and heating its claWS‚
“ what, oh Ξ Gradivus, art thou devising of such import? For
calm in deep descent
“ sinks Jupiter ε and the kindly star of Venus
‘is dull, and Cyllenius swift in his course is stationary‚
66 5 ‘and Mars alone holds the sky. Why have the constellations
“ left their courseS, and roll along with dimmed light,
“ while Orion’ s sword- -girt side is far too brilliant?
“ The rage of arms is near us ι and the sword’ s power
“ shall upset all right by violence : and to abandoned crime ’

670 “the name shall be virtue : and over many years shall extend

“this madneSS. And what boots it to ask of the gods the
end Ρ

“With a master your longed—for peace comes Ρ Carry on, oh!
Rome 1

“ an unbroken chain of ills, and extend disasters for ageS‚

“ now that thou art free only while civil war lastS.''
675 Such prophecies had fully terrified the panic-stricken mob,
but greater come upon thern. For as from the top of Pindus
an Edonian bacchanal rushes down inspired by Ogygian

so too a matron is borne through the amazed city,

with these words proclaiming that Phoebus is moving her
breast.
680 “Whither am Ι borne oh! Paean? wasted through aether
“in what land dost thou place me P I see Pangaea hoary
“ with snow-capped topS‚ and wide Philippi under the crag
of Haemus

“ What frenzy this is oh 1 Phoebus 1 explain: to what end do
Roman ranks

“ join issue of weapons and strength? and does a war arise
without a foe Ρ

685 “In what new direction am Ι borne? Thou leadest me to

the earliest East,

“ where the sea is affected by the influx of the Nile of Lagus,

“ Him who lies mangled and headless on the river-sand
