Bk. 1. 241—267] LUCAN'S PHARSALIA. 11

Broken was the rest of the people, and the youth, roused from

⁷ their coucheS,

pulled down arms fastened to the sacred imageS‚

such as long peace supplied: shields crumbling with their
frames

now bare they seize, and pila curved in point,

24 5 and swords rough with the inroads of black rust.

When the well-known eagles and Roman standards blazed
forth,

and Caesar was beheld towering in the midst of the rankS,

they stood stiff with sear z cold dread seized their limbs:

and they revolved unspoken complaints in silent breastS.

2 50 Oh 1 walls of ours built with the Gauls unhappily near!

Oh! walls condemned to an unhappy position! F irm peace
is there

through all nations and calm repose : we are the prey of the
furious

and their first camp. Better‚ oh! Fortune, hadst thou given us

a site under the eastern orb, and the cold ArctOS,

2 55 and wandering abodeS, than to hold the key of Latium.

We first saw the commotions of the Senones and of the furious
Cimbri,

and Libya's Mars, and the course of the Teuton fusy.

As often as Fortune assails Rome,

this is the route of war. So each with secret groan‚
260 not daring to show open sear: no voice to grief
was entrusted: but aS, when winter stills the birds,
the fields are silent, and the mid-sea is hushed without a
murmur,

so great the stillneSS. Light had dispelled the cold shades of
night.

Lo Ξ torches of war, and goads urging him to battle,

265 the fates supply to his wavering resolution and burst through
all hesitation of shame : Fortune strives that the movements
of her leader should have just grounds and invents excuses for

arms·
