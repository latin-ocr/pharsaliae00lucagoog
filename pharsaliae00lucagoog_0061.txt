Bk. 1. 490—512] - LUCAn's PHARSALIA. 21

490 themselves have hurried from their seatS, and the hateful
orders for war

already in flight the senate decrees to the consuls,

Then what places of security to seek for, what as insecure to
abandon, , ’

not knowing, whither headlong flight carried each, they drive
before them

the people headlong, and encumbered in the long procession

495 they hurry forth the crowdS. You might believe either that

merciless flames

had seized upon the buildings, or that already, with waving

downfall

the houses swa'yed and tottered: so through the city the
crowd,

tearing on with headlong step, as if for their ruined circum-
stances

their only hope were, to leave their ancestral walls,
500 rushes madly on. Just as when tempestuous Auster
has driven back the huge main from the Libyan SyrteS,
and the crash of the massive mast that bears the sail has been
· heard, ¹
leaving the vessel, the skipper leaps into the sea,

and sailor too: and though not yet the beams of the keel

have sundered,
505 yet each makes shipwreck for himself: so, the city left,

to war they fiee : no son the parent now worn out with years

was able to recal, nor spouse her husband

with tears, nor till they should form dim hopes of safety

did the Lares of their fathers detain them: nor on his
threshold “

510 did any one stop, nor, with his eyes feasted with a then per-
haps last gaze

at his beloved city, depart: beyond recall the masses rush
forth.

Oh! gods! ready to grant the heights of ambition ι to guard .

those heights
