24 LucAn’s PHARSALIA. [Bk. 1. 566—392

And ill-omened chaunts of the prophetess of Cumae are spread
among the people. Next those whom cruel Bellona inspires
with gashed arms sang the gods' ire3 and tossing their red
hair
the Galli howled forth dismal prophecies to the people.
570 Urnjffilledr-udthflpacked bones (of the departed) emitted

oanS.
Then ῐξεξ clash of armS‚ and loud voices were heard

through the pathless thickets of groveS, and ghosts coming to
close quarterS. μμ ”

And those who dwelt in the fields immediately adj0ining the
outside walls,

betake themselves to ssight: for a huge Eury was surrounding
the city

57 5 brandishing a down-held pine with flaming point,
and shaking her hissing locks : such was she that urged on
Theban Agave ε or the Eumenid which directed the weapons
of the raging Lycurgus: such she, at whom at the instinct

of hard-hearted Juno ⁵
Alcides shuddered‚ after visiting Pluto, Megaera.

580 Trumpets sounded ε and the shouting with which cohorts
engage‚ such did gloomy night, from her silent shadeS‚
send forth. And, seen to rise in the mid-CampuS,
the manes of Sulla chaunted dismal oracleS.

And at the sight of MariuS, as he raised his heassjssffln- the

 

burst tomb
585 by the ccild streams of Anio, the husbandmen fled.
For these things it was determined that after ancient usage q
Tuscan seers be fetched‚ of whom ArunS, he, that of greatest
a e
dwelt in gthe walls of deserted Luca, Ι
taught in the movements of the lightning, and the still warm
vems ’
590 of entraiIS, and the warnings of the wing that flits in air‚=
first orders monstrositieS, which from no seed
discordant nature has produced, to be seized‚ and the un-

natural offspring
