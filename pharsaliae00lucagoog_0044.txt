LUCAN’s PHARSALIA. [Bk. Ι. 68—89

My mind leads me to set forth the causes of so great
eventS, ,
and a vast work is opened out, as to what causes drove to
arms
70 a raging people‚ what wrenched peace from the earth.
A baleful chain of fated events: and the refusal to the highest
powers

long to continue: and heavy downfalls under weight too
ea
and Rogriie tnot tolerant of herself. So when, the fastening
g1ven way,
· the last hour shall have brought together so many ages of the
world
75 all things will again return to their original chaosz with
mingled

stars shall stars clash t the fiery constellations

shall seek the deep: the earth refuse to keep her line of
shore, a-

and to repel the sea ε opposed to her brother shall Phoebe

move, and, refusing to drive her two-horse car through a
wandering

80 course, will demand day for herself : and the whole machine

of the

world in discordance will throw into confusion its law8.

Great things perish by self-wrought destruction: this limit of
increase

have the deities assigned to prosperous things, Nor to ex-
ternal nations

did Fortune hand over her malice towards a people‚ powerful
by land

85 and by sea. Thou wert the cause of ills Oh ! Rome!

made a common kingdom to three tyrantS‚ and the deadly
compact of

sovereignty‚ never before committed to a plurality.

Oh l unhappy in your harmony, Oh Ι blind 'with excessive
greed‚

what boots it to join your powerS‚ and to hold the universe
