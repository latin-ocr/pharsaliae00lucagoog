the wavering TyroneS, do camps at intervals keep guard o'er
the nationS.
440 Scoming to pine amid thy mistS, oh! Meduana, the
Andian is now refreshed by the unmolested wave of Liger3
the renowned Genabos is set free from Caesar’s squadronS.

and cowardly is it held, to be sparing of life that must return.
465 And ye t00, who were stationed to restrain from war the curly
C‘ayci
make for Rome, and leave the inhospitable banks of the
Rhine,
