12 LUCAN'S PHARsAmA. [Bk. 1. 268—290

From the divided' city the seditious tribunes, their rights
ignored,
the senate-house, minacious with the fate of the oft cited
Gracchi, drave forth.
270 These, as they make for the standards of their leader already
in motion
and near, Curio accompanies with his venal tongue of
effrontery.
He that was once the voice of the people, that dared to
uphold liberty,
and to bring armed grandees to the level of the plebs.
And when he beheld his leader revolving dubious cares
27 5 in his breast: “While'' he exclaimed‘ ‘by my voice your
interests
“ Oh! Caesar could be forwarded, however against the
senate's will,
“ then we prorogued your command, when it was my right
“to hold the Rostra and to take over the wavering Quirites
'to your side.
‘⁴ But after that the laws have been hushed under compulsion
of war,
280 “ we are driven from our country’s homeS, and we voluntarily
endure
“ exile : thy conquests shall make us citizens
“ While their party waverS, strengthened with no support,
“ away with delayS. To defer hath ever prejudiced the
prepared.
“ Equal toil and peril lie before yon, with a greater reward.
285 “ Waging war through lustra twain did Gaul detain thee,
“ how small a portion of the world! If you shall succeed in
fighting a few battles
“with successful issue, for thee Rome will have subdued the
universe.
“ Now on thy return neither does the stream of a long triumph
“await thee, nor does the Capitol demand the sacred bayS.
290 “ Biting envy denies thee all ε and for subduing nations
