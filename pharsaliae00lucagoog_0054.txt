14 . LUCAN's PHARSAOIA. [Bk 1. 317—343

“keep Pompey in perpetual sway through so long a period Ρ
“ Shall he guide the triumphal car, ere his years permit it?
“ Shall he never lay down honours once unlawfully seized?
3²0 “Why should Ι now complain of countries throughout the
whole world closed,
“ and hunger pressed 1nto his service ? Who knows not of troops
“introduced into the panic- -stricken forum Ρ When threatening
'swords
“surrounded the gloomy Jury, awe-struck by the unusual ring,
“ and while soldiers broke in upon the mid-course of law,
325 “the standards of Pompey hemmed in Milo on his trial?
“ Now too lest a retiring old age should keep him in wearineSS,
“ he prepares civil warS, accustomed to civil 3ῐῐῐι5,
“ and ready to surpass Sulla, that master of crime.
“And as savage tigers ne'er lay aside their ferocity‚
330 “which in the Hyrcanian grove, ere they leave their mother's
den,
“the deep draught of gore from the slaughtered herds has
nourished,
“ so too for thee, wont to lick the sword of Sulla,
“ thy thirst Oh ! Magnus ! endureS. No blood once imbibed
“in the mouth allows the polluted jaws to yield their thirst
for blood.
335 “ Yet what end shall such protracted power find ?
“What is the limit of crimes? From this sovereignty now,
oh basest !
“let that Sulla, thy pattern, at least teach thee to retire.
“ After defeating the roving Cilician pirates and engagements
in Pontus
“with a worn- out king, scarcely brought to a close by barbaric
poison,
340 ‘⁴ shall Caesar be assigned to Pompey as a final province,
“ because, when ordered to lower my victorious eagleS,
“I obeyed not? If from me the earnings of my toils have
been wrested,
“to these at any rate, without their leader, let their rewards
for long
