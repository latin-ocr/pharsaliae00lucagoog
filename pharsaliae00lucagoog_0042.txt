LUCAN's PHARSALIA. [Bk. 1. 21--42

ffen, if so great be your love, Oh! Rome, for hateful war,

when you shall have reduced under Latian laws the whole
world,

But now that walls are tottering from buildings half-down-
thrown,

in the cities of Italy, and from the fallen ramparts vast

stones lie low, and dwellings are possessed by no occupant to
guard them,

and but here and there wanders the inhabitant in cities of
times-gone-bye,

that bristling with brambles and unploughed for many years ’

Hesperia lies, and hands are wanting to the fields that call
for them, .

not thou, brave PyrrhuS, nor the Carthaginian will be ⁸found

author of ruin so great: to no external sword utterly to
dismember Rome

has it fallen : of citizens’ right >hands the blows sink‘deep.

But if no other way for a Nero to come have the fates

discovered, and at a great price eternal kingdoms are

’ founded ,

for Gods, and Heaven could not be reduced under its own
T hunderer, ’

save after conflicts of furious giantS,

then nought‚ Oh! ye godS‚ do we complain': crimes them-
selves and impiety

at this price are acceptableflet Pharsalia fill her hateful
plainS,

and let the shades of the Carthaginians be glutted with
blood:

let remotest battles be fought on fatal Munda.

To these destined eventS, Oh! Caesar, let the famine of
Perusia, and the hardships of Mutina

be added: and the fleets which rugged Leucadia holds sunk

(by her cliffs),
