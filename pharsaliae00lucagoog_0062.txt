22 LUCAN’s PHARSALIA. [Bk. 1. 513—541

unwilling! A city, crowded with peoples and with conquered
nations‚ and, if the throng could be assembled, able to contain
515 the human race, a ready prey at Caesar’s approach .
the hands of cowards yielded. When hemmed in by the
enemy
the Roman soldier is beleagured in foreign strandS,
he escapes the nightlong dangers under cover of a slight
defence, ’
and the quickly raised rampart by its protection of hurriedly
turned sod
520 furnishes peaceful slumbers within the tentS.
Thou, merely on hearing of the mention of warS, oh! Rome!
art deserted : thy walls give not security for a single night.
Yet pardon must be granted, yeS, granted for praise so great 3 -
on Pompey’s ssight, men sear. Then that no hope at least
52 5 for the future may raise their mindS, there were added
undoubted evidences of destiny still worse: and the gods
with threats
filled earth and skyand sea with prodigies-

f Gloomy nights saw stars unknown beTore,
s and the pole lit up with flames, and flying in the sky
. 530 fires athwart the space, and the tail of the meteor
*X portentous, and the comet that proclaims tyrannies for earth.

Lightnings flashed frequently in clear sky that belied itself,
and the flame took various forms in the dense atmosphere:
now as a dart with lengthened light, now as a lamp with
scattered,
535 it flashed forth from heaven, In stillness without clouds
above
and hurrying its flame from the Northern quarter
a bolt struck the summit of the Latian temple: and smaller
starS,
wont through the void of night-time to run their course,
came forth in mid-day: and with diminished crescent,
540 when Phoebe was now reflecting her brother with full orb,
she dimmed‚ struck by a sudden shadow from earth.
