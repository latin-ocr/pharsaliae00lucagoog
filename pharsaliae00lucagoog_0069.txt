Bk. 1. 688—697] LUCAN'S PHARSALIA. 29

“ Ι recognise ε over the main to treacherous Syrtis
“ and patched Libya Ι am borne, whithera relentless Erinnys
690 “has transported the Emathian hosts, Now o'er the ridges
“ of cloud-capped Alps and Pyrenees that tower to the sky
“ Ι am hurried away. Back to the seat of my native city
I return, ι
“ and murderous conflicts are enacted in mid-senate.
“ The factions rise a second time : and over the whole world
695 “ again I go. Grant me to see the fresh shores of PontUS‚
“and a fresh country: Philippi I have already seen, oh!
Phoebus.’'

She spake,·and fell, swooned in worn-out madneSS.
